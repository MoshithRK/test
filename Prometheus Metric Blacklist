# Prometheus Metric Blacklist Configuration Guide

---

## 1. **Configuring Metric Relabeling**

To drop specific metrics in Prometheus, you need to add a `metric_relabel_configs` section to your scrape job configuration. This section allows you to specify which metrics should be excluded from scraping or storage.

### 1.1 **Edit the Prometheus Configuration File**

1. Open the Prometheus configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
   ```

2. Locate the `scrape_configs` section where your scrape jobs are defined. Add the following `metric_relabel_configs` block under the appropriate job (e.g., Node Exporter).

### 1.2 **Example Configuration**

Here’s an example of how to configure Prometheus to drop specific metrics:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:19095']
        labels:
          instance: 'node1'
    metric_relabel_configs:         # Relabeling configuration to drop specific metrics
      - source_labels: [__name__]
        regex: 'go_memstats_mallocs_total|node_entropy_pool_size_bits|node_boot_time_seconds|node_cpu_guest_seconds_total|node_cpu_seconds_total'
        action: drop
```

### 1.3 **Explanation**

- **source_labels**: Specifies the label or labels to match against. Here, `__name__` is used, which refers to the metric name.
- **regex**: A regular expression pattern that matches the metric names you want to drop. In this example, several metrics related to memory, CPU, and system boot time are being dropped.
- **action**: The action to take when a match is found. The `drop` action excludes the matched metrics from being scraped or stored.

## 2. **Apply the Configuration**

1. After editing the file, save and close it.

2. Reload Prometheus to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload prometheus
   ```

## 3. **Verifying the Configuration**

1. Check Prometheus logs to ensure there are no errors:
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep prometheus
   ```

2. You can also visit the Prometheus web UI and search for the metrics you have dropped to confirm they are no longer present.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you’ve successfully configured Prometheus to drop specific metrics, helping to reduce unnecessary data processing and storage. This can be especially beneficial for optimizing performance in environments with large-scale metric collections.
